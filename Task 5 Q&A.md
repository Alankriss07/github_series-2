# GitHub Series - Task 5
========================

## How GitHub works ?
Ans: GitHub is a highly used software which is typically used for **version control**. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. 
**Working on GitHub :** There is one central repository. Each developer clones the repo, works locally on the code, makes commits, and push it to central 
repository. Then, a pull request is made asking owner of repo to implement the changes(by merging) made if the owner finds them useful.

#### Fundamental elements of git workflow

Git Workflow consist of the four fundamental elements: 
• **Workspace**(also known as Working Directory) and if we consider a file, it can have 3 states:
    (a)Committed : meaning latest changes in the data is stored in local repo.
    (b)Modified: means the changes are done but are not securely stored or will not be reflected in local repository.
    (c)Staged: meaning file is part of index element.

• **Index**(also known as Stage)
• **Local Repository**(also known as Head)
• **Remote Repository**

## What is Cloning?   
The git clone *command* copies an existing **Git repository**. This is sort of like SVN checkout, except the “working copy” is a full-fledged 
Git repository—it has its own history, manages its own files, and is a completely isolated environment from the original repository.
**Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo.** This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than
 directly in the source files of the origin repo. Here’s how to clone a GitHub repository.

## What is Forking?
A fork is a **copy of a repository**. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original
 project.Creating a *"fork”* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project.
When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account.
 Whereas, when you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine with the help of Git.
Fork in git means making a personal copy of others repository which we can modify without affecting the original project whereas Clone 
is used to create a local copy of the remote repository. This process helps us to edit and modify files locally
 
## What is a Pull Request?
 Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, 
interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.**

## Issues:
Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be 
shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues,
 and has its own section in every repository.
