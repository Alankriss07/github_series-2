# INTRODUCTION
============

## Hey Everyone,

My name is **Somil Swapnil Chandra**, I am persuing Btech from **DIT University ,Dehradun**. I am native of Almora,Uttarakhand and have recieved my schooling from the same.

 I am an eager learner and have achieved quite a bit academically and also in sports , that include medals and certificates.

 I really think that these tutorials on git have greatly enchanced my knowledge and have 
 done a commendable job in developing a developer's insight.

 At last a very warm and heartly thnx to all the *git mentors* for such an enthusiastic initiative
